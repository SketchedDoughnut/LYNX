# lynx
Local (yielding?) Network (eXchange?)

# Introduction
lynxy, also known as lynx, is a LAN server-client system coded in Python. It allows for easy setup of a server, as well as easy setup for clients on the same network as the server. 
The first section will explain instructions that apply to both, and then we will cover each individual part.

# Setup
Before we do anything, you should first install this module with pip. <br>
`pip install (TBD)`
`python3 -m pip install (TBD)`

When you do this, it will install both the modules "lynxy" and "lynxy_server". Once this is done, you are ready to read the instructions on the following sections about setting up your client, server, or both.

# Server setup
To set up the server module, you first need to import it. <br>
`import lynxy_server`
